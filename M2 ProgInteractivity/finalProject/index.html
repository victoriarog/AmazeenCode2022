        <h2>What is an orange cat?</h2>

        <p>
          Orange cat is a type of household cat, 
          with distinctive orange/auburn coat colouring. 
          Commonly acquired in dumpsters or any animal shelter
          if you are feeling fancy. Member of a <i>Felis catus</i> family of
          mammals, known to be our sidekicks since the dawn of times.

        <p>
          They are known for having exactly ONE braincell,
          that is orange and is commonly shared between all of them
          at any given moment, which makes for great, albeit concerning
          at times, companion for your daily struggles with reality.
          Members of <i>Felis catus</i> family are known to alleviate stress
          and bad moods by being cute, fluffy and absolutely adorable, but in turn
          are also infamous for wrecking havoc everywhere and screaming loudly when 
          they want something from you. Life with them is but a mere balance.

      <h2>So why one braincell?</h2><br><br>
      <p>
        "It has been proven with research, that all orange cats share one
        brain cell at any given moment, that just bounces around their head, 
        something ado to a DVD screen saver." - Dr. Susanna Mewston, UCAT. - 
        "Sometimes it hits a corner and a thought has a chance to form, although
        we are not certain as we always miss that moment." 
      </p>
      <p>
        As you read, scientists or, as we call them, <i>catologists</i>, aren't sure 
        themselves of this peculiar phenomenon happening to our orange friends. 
        We can, however, be certain that research is still ongoing and we are all
        eager to find out what is the root cause of this is. Another important question
        raised is, can an orange cat has no or negative number of braincells?

        As you can see from this supporting exhibit of imagery,
        these members of the feline family do posess some awareness,
        but the extent of it is unknows to the mankind. Some lucky 
        researchers have these animals at home and get to carry out their 
        research almost constantly, which is invaluable to the advancements 
        in this scientific area.

        It is also important to consider valuable contributions from our amazing
        community of researchers, that provide us with daily updates on 
        their most intricate specimen observations.

          From craftfully picked snapshots of specimen, we can deduce 
          that indeed, all of them are in posession of some braincell, but 
          it is not possible to conclude that it is one common braincell or 
          each has a personal, or the extent of so-called <i>"stupidity"</i> that 
          is well-known to be present in the research objects.

        To conclude this brief dive into intricate science of 
        orange cats, I'd like to provide you with a very deep quote,
        produced by one of our most esteemed researchers, Dr. Meowya 
        Whiskers, UCAT Ph.D - <b>"They stupid as hell, but they do be funny."</b>

        One would hope that funding and community interest in this topic
        shall never run dry, as ridding the world of the gift of knowledge is 
        one the most cardinal sins.
